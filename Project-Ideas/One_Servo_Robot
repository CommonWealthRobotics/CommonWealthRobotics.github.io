Create a robot that is interesting, but requires only one servo and few pieces to be functional. 
This robot would serve as an entry-level project for a classroom that has many students but few resources. Each
child working with this robot should be able to create a final product that is unique and different from their classmates.
Parameterizing the parts of the robot would add another way for students to create something untque.
