The DyIO is a Dynamic Input and output device. It has 24 channels and each one can be reconfigured into all sorts of modes. Each channel can be digital input, digital output and hobby servo. Certain channels also have analog inputs, Waveform (PWM) generation, and many more options. 

Devices like the DyIO are passed to scripts using the name found on the MyDevices (The upper left of BowlerStudio) tab. All currently connected devices are passed to each script. For more detailed DyIO scripting, head over to the DyIo Tutorials: 

  [DyIO Scripting Tutorials](/DyIO-Programming/Digital-Input-Example-Simple/).

If you had a DyIO connected when you started BowlerStudio you should have seen a connection dialog box.
You can check to see if the DyIO is connected by clicking on the 'My Devices' tab.
