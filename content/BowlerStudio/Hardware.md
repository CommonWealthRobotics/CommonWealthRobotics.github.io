BowlerStudio can connect to all sorts of hardware, from Microcontrollers, to scanners to cameras. 

[Check out the full list of hardware examples HERE](/Bowler-Studio-Hardware/DyIOScripting/)

BowlerStudio integrates OpenCV's new Java bindings to add full power and full speed image processing to your robotic project. 
Image processing objects can be chained together to form processing pipelines. All default Haar cascades are bundled in the application, and the full API is available in the scripting interface to add custom image processors.
