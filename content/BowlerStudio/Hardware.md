BowlerStudio can connect to all sorts of hardware, from microcontrollers, to scanners to cameras. 

[Check out the full list of hardware examples HERE](/Bowler-Studio-Hardware/DyIOScripting/)

This example is to visualize the BNO055 IMU using SimplePacketComs over UDP. Run the example after you have connected your BNO055 to your ESP32's i2c port. Install the arduino library for BNO055SimplePacketComs and run the example from that library called BNO055Server. Once the hardware is set up, run this script to visualize the IMU data.
