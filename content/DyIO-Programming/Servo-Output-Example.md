Servo output channels are used to let you control a hobby servo from the DyIO. The DyIo can support up to 24 servos at once. Servos can be told to go to a position immediately or slowly over time. A battery is needed to power the servo and the jumper on your dyio should be set to motors, with the battery connected.
