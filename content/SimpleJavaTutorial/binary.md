#Bits
Bits are a single value of 1 or 0 and are the basic thing a computer understands. Also known as true as 1 and false as 0, these values make up the basic building blocks of all computing. 

In the electrical world, applying a voltage to a a pin will make it go from false to true. This means Bits are very easy to store, move and read electrically. 

A bit represents 2 values, and so each bit you add together is in base 2. Most math in the 0-9 scale is in base 10, as in each unit is 10 times the last. In base 2, also known as binary, each unit is 2 times the last. Base 10 is hard to make electrical circuits understand, unlike binary, which is easy. 



#Bytes

A byte is a set of 8 bits. The selection of 8 bits to make the standard byte size was decided by convention and is now a standard of computer languages.
