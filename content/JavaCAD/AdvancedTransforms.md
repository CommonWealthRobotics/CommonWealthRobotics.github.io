In this example we use lists of transform to move the same object to many locations. If you have nuts and bolts all over a part, or want to for a pattern of objects, this use of transforms is useful. 

Note transforms behave a bit differently than normal CSG's. Opperations should be applied in reverse order. This means a rotaion before a translate will translate first than rotate.
