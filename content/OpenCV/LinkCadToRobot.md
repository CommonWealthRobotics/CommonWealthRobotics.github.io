step: 21

In this example we will load a robot and create a cad generator for it. The cad generator is a factory that lets you pass a robot design to a Factory that you write. Your factory reads information about the robot from its design and makes CAD from it. You can also attach listeners loaded form the robot design so your cad is animated by your robots Forward Kinematics.
